### Logo Styling Recommendations

For a consistent look and feel across the website, consider the following modifications to the logos:

1. **Color Consistency**: 
   - Option 1: Convert all logos to white color for better contrast against the dark background
   - Option 2: Apply the website's accent color (#EAAA00) to all logos

2. **Background Shape**:
   - Consider placing all logos on a consistent circular or rounded rectangle background
   - This creates visual harmony across different logo styles

3. **Size Consistency**:
   - Resize all logos to maintain similar visual weight
   - Recommended dimensions: approximately 60-80px height
